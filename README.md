## Project Description

Welcome to RTR (Read, Think, React OR Rater, whatever one prefers really).  
This is supposed to be a newssite that reminds the user A BIT of reddit.  
See the project inception section for the initial thought process that lead up to the "finished" product.

### Project Inception and Purpose

I started planning based on the idea of a "Reddit-style newssite", but i wanted something less "subjective" in terms of what is posted.  
I do not use Reddit all that much, but i do use it enough to know there are things i like and dont like about it, so i started from there.  
Also, it should be a bit more focused on concrete objectiveness and reasoning, "back it up with facts" was in the back of my mind the whole time.  
Some of this is more philosophical than technical, but i tried to make the functionality of the site reflect that mindset.

#### Pros and Cons of Reddit

* Pros:
  * Loads of Topics
  * Finding content you like is quick.
  * Posting Content and responding to it is easy.
  * Sign-up is quick and easy, as most pages are these days.
  * I like the comment section (structurally, the actual discourse is another matter).
  * Ability to follow threads that are relevant to users interests

* Cons:
  * The Karma and Downvote system seems very vulnerable to arbitrary whim, which was something i wanted to avoid.
  * Even in "factual threads", there is a lot of "trashposting", i wanted to separate this from other content.

## Future Implementation

### Comment Reply System

* Limited to the posts author replying to comments as of now.

### Notification system

* This is needed for the Comment Reply System to be practical.

### NewsCatcher News-API

* This was originally implemented many months ago, sadly only had 50 free requests and the subscription-price is steep.  
  Contacted NewsCatcher about adding more requests to my api-key, did not get an answer back.  
  Thought about keeping the code for reference,  
  but it's technically broken so finally decided on removing it altogether.  
  Will keep looking for a replacement.
